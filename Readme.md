# A Watched Pot Never Boils

This repo uses a Raspberry Pi and a 433Mhz remote controlled socket to enforce the old idiom, "A Watched Pot Never Boils". 

This code is unmaintained, and was written at 4am after seeing a video by Tom Scott that contained this very concept. 

A writeup of how this was done can be found on my blog, [here]()
